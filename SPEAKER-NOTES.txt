--SPEAKER NOTES--

START
  - Introduce self. Connexta. Data Science Coursera
  - What do these buzz words mean? data science, machine learning 
  - Cover outline

IRIS
-Confusion matrix
  -TP/FP
  -Confidence interval - sample size and strength of result
  - P-value. If p smaller than 0.05, results are "statistically significant"
  - Kappa. How much better than random guessing?
-Other
 - Sensitivity. How likey am I to miss one of these?
 - Specificity. How likely am I to mistake something for one of these?

BIG DATA
- Volume
  - Ask audience how much data is big?
  - How about 5 terabytes?
- Velocity
  - Ask how fast is big data?
  - How about a 1 GB/s ?
- Variety
  - Click streams and server logs
  - Sensors - cars, oil fields, satelites, facebook posts
- Veracity
  - Most data is crap
  - Project Guttenburg
    - Aristotle's Ethics=646 KB. 
    - Complete works of Shakespeare=5.3 MB
- Small Data - Stats packages like R. In memory, single threaded
- Big Data - Distributed, data center, infrastructure, $$$
- Pioneers - Physicists
- Real life big data + machine learning = Netflix challenge
